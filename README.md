# Using Pre trained MobileNetV2 for Brain Tumor Detection
Leveraging MobileNetV2, to offer an  effective brain tumor detection model.

This work analyses the automated brain tumor detection from MRI images using MobileNetV2. Indicating rather good performance in separating tumor and non-tumor cases, the model was found to have a test accuracy of 90.62%, an AUC of 0.9909, and a test loss of 0.2775. Strong classification abilities are shown by the key results, which show perfect recall (1.00) for the ”NO” class and great
accuracy (1.00) for the ”YES” class. Together with data augmentation and transfer learning, the model’s efficiency qualifies it as a perfect model for settings with limited resources. These results show MobileNetV2’s promise as a consistent tool for exact early brain tumor diagnosis. To enhance the models performance on generalisability and resilience user larger dataset with various MRI images could be beneficial. Edge or mobile platform model optimisation for real-time applications could make it deployable on systems with constrained resources. Further improvements of performance could come from more hyperparameter optimization and researching advanced regularising methods.
