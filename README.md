# Using Pre trained MobileNetV2 for Brain Tumor Detection
Leveraging MobileNetV2, to offer an  effective brain tumor detection model.

One of the most deadly health risks, brain tumors, need to be detected using effective and accurate detection methods to minimize the risks. Traditional MRI analysis takes time and needs specialised interpretation. Deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has proven to be a good alternative for fast and accurate tumor detection. This article explores using pre-trained MobileNetV2 with transfer learning, for the automatic detection of brain tumors from MRI scans. The model is fine-tuned with custom layers for binary classification and achieved 90.62% accuracy on the test, had an AUC of 0.9909, and a test loss of 0.2775. The key outcomes are high classification accuracy (1.00) of the ”YES” class and perfect recall (1.00) of the ”NO” class, indicating outstanding
classification ability with balanced precision, recall and F1 scores. The model’s training and fine-tuning are optimized using learning rate scheduling, data augmentation and class weighting. The model’s effectiveness makes it ideal for settings with limited resources. These results validate the potential of MobileNetV2 as an effective tool for early and precise diagnosis of brain tumors. Future work can involve a larger dataset, expanding the network to multi-class classification

This work analyses the automated brain tumor detection from MRI images using MobileNetV2. Indicating rather good performance in separating tumor and non-tumor cases, the model was found to have a test accuracy of 90.62%, an AUC of 0.9909, and a test loss of 0.2775. Strong classification abilities are shown by the key results, which show perfect recall (1.00) for the ”NO” class and great
accuracy (1.00) for the ”YES” class. Together with data augmentation and transfer learning, the model’s efficiency qualifies it as a perfect model for settings with limited resources. These results show MobileNetV2’s promise as a consistent tool for exact early brain tumor diagnosis. To enhance the models performance on generalisability and resilience user larger dataset with various MRI images could be beneficial. Edge or mobile platform model optimisation for real-time applications could make it deployable on systems with constrained resources. Further improvements of performance could come from more hyperparameter optimization and researching advanced regularising methods.
